# IBM_Data_Science_and_Machine_Learning_Capstone_Project
This project implements a complete analytical pipeline for evaluating and predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 landing outcomes. Data was sourced through the SpaceX API and enhanced with web-scraped mission details. The dataset was subsequently cleaned, normalized, and enriched through structured data-wrangling procedures.  SQL-based exploration validated data integrity and supported targeted queries on launch sites, booster configurations, payload profiles, and mission results. Exploratory Data Analysis provided operational insights into key performance drivers such as payload mass, orbit type, and flight history.  A machine learning workflow was established to benchmark multiple classification algorithms, optimized via GridSearchCV. The Decision Tree model demonstrated superior predictive performance and was selected as the final model.  The project concludes with an interactive Dash application that enables stakeholders to visualize mission outcomes, compare launch sites, and explore payload success patterns.
